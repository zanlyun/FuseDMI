main = 
let x0 = 105 in 
let y0 = 142 in 
let w0 = 23 in 
let h0 = 111 in
let dx = 50 in
let color = 172 in
{ rect { 0, color, x0, y0, w0, h0}
 ,rect { 0, color, x0+dx, y0, w0, h0}
 ,rect { 0, color, x0+dx+dx, y0, w0, h0}}
;


2. add const 
main = 
let x0 = const 154 in 
let y0 = const 142 in 
let w0 = 23 in 
let h0 = 111 in
let dx = 50 in
let color = 172 in
{ rect { 0, color, const x0, y0, w0, h0}
 ,rect { 0, color, const x0+dx, y0, w0, h0}
 ,rect { 0, color, const x0+dx*3, y0, w0, h0}}
;
